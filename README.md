Ham/spam Identifier
Perform Imports and Load Data
For this exercise we'll be using the SMSSpamCollection dataset from UCI datasets that contains more than 5 thousand SMS phone messages.
You can check out the sms_readme file for more info.

The file is a tab-separated-values (tsv) file with four columns:

label - every message is labeled as either ham or spam
message - the message itself
length - the number of characters in each message
punct - the number of punctuation characters in each message
